## What is OpenForge?

OpenForge is an open-source developer collaboration platform designed to explore transparent project workflows and Web3-aware integrations. This prototype focuses on testing wallet connectivity, basic project interactions, and milestone-oriented flows.

Many features are experimental and subject to change.

---

## Requirements

Before using OpenForge, make sure you have:

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Brave, Firefox)
* A Web3 wallet: **MetaMask**
* Some **Sepolia test ETH** (free)

---

## Setting Up MetaMask

### 1️⃣ Install MetaMask

Download MetaMask from the official site and install the browser extension.

Create a wallet or import an existing one.
**Never share your seed phrase.**

---

### 2️⃣ Switch MetaMask to Sepolia Test Network

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the **network selector** (top of the extension)
3. Enable **“Show test networks”** (if not already enabled)
4. Select **Sepolia**

Your wallet is now connected to the Sepolia test network.

---

## Getting Free Sepolia ETH (Test Only)

Since this is a prototype, OpenForge uses **test ETH**, not real money.

### Recommended Faucets:

* Sepolia Faucet by Alchemy
* Sepolia Faucet by Infura

Steps:

1. Copy your wallet address from MetaMask
2. Paste it into a Sepolia faucet
3. Request test ETH
4. Wait a few seconds for the transaction to confirm

You should now see Sepolia ETH in your MetaMask wallet.

---

## Connecting Your Wallet to OpenForge

1. Open the OpenForge application
2. Click **“Connect Wallet”**
3. Approve the connection in MetaMask
4. Ensure MetaMask is set to **Sepolia**

If the network is incorrect, MetaMask will prompt you to switch.
