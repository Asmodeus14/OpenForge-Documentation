# Contributing to OpenForge

> ⚠️ **Prototype / Early Stage**
> OpenForge is an early-stage project. Processes, features, and funding mechanisms are experimental and may change.

---

## Why Contribute?

OpenForge is built as an open platform for developers to collaborate on real projects with transparency. Contributions help shape the platform itself and the projects built on top of it.

You can contribute by:

* Improving the OpenForge codebase
* Reporting bugs or UX issues
* Suggesting features
* Participating in projects hosted on OpenForge

---

## How Contributions Work

### 1️⃣ Platform Contributions (OpenForge Core)

If you’re contributing directly to OpenForge:

* Fork the repository
* Create a feature or fix branch
* Open a pull request with a clear description
* Be open to feedback and revisions

There is **no automatic payment** for core contributions at this stage.

---

### 2️⃣ Project Contributions (Funding-Based)

Some projects posted on OpenForge may offer **token-based or crypto funding** for contributors.

Important points:

* Funding is **project-specific**, not platform-wide
* Terms are defined by the **project owner**
* OpenForge does **not guarantee payments**
* All funding is experimental and for testing purposes

---

## Getting Access to Project Funding

If you are interested in funded contributions:

### 👉 Join the OpenForge Global Chatroom

Project owners announce:

* Open tasks
* Contribution requirements
* Funding terms
* Token or crypto-based rewards

Discussions happen openly so expectations are clear before you contribute.

> 💬 **Global Chatroom = coordination hub**
> This is where contributors and project owners connect.

---

## About Tokens & Funding (Important)

* Tokens are **not platform rewards**
* Tokens are **not guaranteed**
* Tokens (if used) belong to the **project**, not OpenForge
* Funding mechanisms are part of **project experimentation**

OpenForge acts as a **collaboration layer**, not a financial intermediary.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

Please follow these principles:

* Be respectful and professional
* Do not overclaim experience or results
* Communicate clearly before starting funded work
* Ask questions if terms are unclear
* Never pressure others for funding

---

## What OpenForge Does NOT Do

To avoid confusion, OpenForge:

* ❌ Does not promise tokens for contributions
* ❌ Does not act as an employer
* ❌ Does not guarantee funding or payouts
* ❌ Is not a financial or investment platform

---

## Feedback & Improvement

OpenForge is evolving.
If something feels unclear or broken:

* Open a GitHub issue
* Start a discussion in the global chatroom
* Suggest improvements to this guide

---

## Final Note

Contribute because you want to build, learn, or collaborate — not because of promised rewards.
Any funding involved should be discussed openly and agreed upon **before work begins**.

Thank you for helping build OpenForge responsibly 🤝
