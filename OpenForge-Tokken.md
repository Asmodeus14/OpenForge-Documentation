# Importing Project Tokens (Testing Only)

> ⚠️ **Prototype Notice**
> Tokens used in OpenForge projects are **for testing and experimentation only**.
> They are **project-specific**, not platform-wide rewards.

## When Do You Need to Import a Token?

If a project distributes **custom tokens** (ERC-20 or similar), they may **not appear automatically** in your wallet.
In that case, you must **manually import the token** using its contract address.

Project owners will share:

* Token contract address
* Network (usually Sepolia)
* Token symbol and decimals (if needed)

---

## Requirements

* Browser wallet: **MetaMask**
* Correct network selected (usually **Sepolia**)
* Token contract address from the project owner

---

## How to Import a Token in MetaMask

### 1️⃣ Open MetaMask

Unlock your wallet and make sure you are on the **correct network** (e.g. Sepolia).

---

### 2️⃣ Go to “Import Tokens”

1. Scroll down in MetaMask
2. Click **Import tokens**
3. Select **Custom token**

---

### 3️⃣ Enter Token Details

Paste the **token contract address** provided by the project.

MetaMask will usually auto-fill:

* Token symbol
* Token decimals

If not, ask the project owner for the correct values.

---

### 4️⃣ Confirm Import

Click **Add Custom Token** → **Import Tokens**

The token should now appear in your wallet.

## Important Notes About Tokens on OpenForge

Please read carefully:

* Tokens are **issued by individual projects**, not OpenForge
* Token value is **not guaranteed**
* Tokens may have **no liquidity**
* Tokens may be **reset, changed, or deprecated**
* OpenForge does **not verify or audit project tokens**

Always clarify terms **before contributing**.

---

## Where to Ask for Token Details

If you don’t have the token address or details:

👉 Join the **OpenForge Global Chatroom**

Project owners use the chatroom to:

* Share token addresses
* Explain contribution terms
* Clarify funding or reward structure

---

## Common Issues & Fixes

**Token not showing after import?**

* Double-check the network
* Confirm the contract address
* Make sure tokens were actually sent

**Wrong token imported?**

* Remove it from MetaMask
* Re-import using the correct address

---

## Disclaimer

Tokens associated with OpenForge projects are **experimental**, **project-scoped**, and **not investment instruments**.
Do not treat them as financial assets.
